<h1>HKArchA Sign-up Page</h1>
<p>Natalie Wong | February 16, 2025</p>

HKArchA is a simple yet elegant sign-up form created with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is fully responsive, ensuring optimal display across all devices (RWD), and was developed as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.
